Clue 1: 
In the player's code it resides,
A mischievous "var" that hides.
It causes mayhem, creates a mess,
Controls reversed, it's anyone's guess.
Fix left to right, that is your test.
Fast or slow, it tells you where to go.
Seek it in the player's code,
Then flip its sign to play once more. 
Minus and plus - two sides of the same coin.
But which one is right?


Clue 2: 
A camera that sees but refuses to roam,
Bound by a function, a static home.
Starts with "func", encased in brackets' pair,
The source of the problem is hidden there.
Seek the line beneath, false lies the root,
Change it to true, the camera will shoot.
What's the remedy for the stationary view?


Clue 3:
In the final scene, a message gone astray,
A label that speaks but doesn't say.
"Game over" it should, but alas it does not,
Click on the culprit, fix the plot.
What's the method to set the script right?


Clue 4: 
In the realm of the player, a function lost,
Altering points, at what cost?
Starts with "func", the brackets hold it tight,
Therein lies the clue, the script's slight.
Look for the sign, the subtracting snake,
Turn it into a cross, points to make.
What's the solution to cease the deduction?
